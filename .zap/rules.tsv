10104   IGNORE	(User Agent Fuzzer | No clear way to fix, probably more server/apache2 related)
10050   IGNORE	(Retrieved from Cache | Using Cloudflare/Github means making use of a proxy with a shared cache)
10109   IGNORE	(Modern Web Application | Information that this is a modern web application)
10027   IGNORE	(Suspicious Comments | This can only be fixed by updating Jquery > Bootstrap > revamp the whole site. Also using slim build on Jquery v3 will remove any trace of username)
90027   IGNORE	(Cookie Slack Detector | This is because we need to use cookies b/c of Cloudflare. Given we only use Cloudflare/Github pages, it's safe to ignore this information)
10015   IGNORE	(Incomplete or No Cache-control and Pragma HTTP Header Set | Because we use Cloudflare/Github pages, no access to server side coding Solution if we get this: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49547/how-do-we-control-web-page-caching-across-all-browsers)
10202   IGNORE	(Absence of Anti-CSRF Tokens | This is because we use Paypal donation links, Paypal does this for us and we can always use something else withoud the html form function)
10020   IGNORE	(X-Frame-Options Header Not Set | Because we use Cloudflare/Github Pages we cannot edit the server side coding, thus we cannot set it like it should: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Frame-Options)
10003   IGNORE	(Vulnerable JS Library | We should update to 3.4 or higher for Jquery, but as 10027 states, it will be alot of work and might be fixed when the site gets a revamp)
10051   IGNORE	(Relative Path Confusion | If we can use server side coding, we can fix this: https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/10051/#:~:text=Summary,relative%2C%20rather%20than%20absolute%20URLs.)
40025   IGNORE	(Proxy Disclosure | This is because we use Cloudflare, we cannot fix this unless we don't use Cloudflare)
10055   IGNORE	(CSP: Wildcard Directive | This is because we use a very oudated scrollReveal.js library. It edits the code in such a way that only unsafe-inline can be used. Perhaps if we can do server coding we can use the nonce- CSP in such a way to allow this)
10098   IGNORE	(Cross-Domain Misconfiguration | This can be fixed if we have access to server coding to set Access-Control-Allow-Origin HTTP header to a more restrictive set of domains, or remove all CORS headers entirely)
10038   IGNORE	(Content Security Policy (CSP) Header Not Set | It's actually set in meta tag of HTML, but again if we have server coding we can fix this, do note that the proxy also has a saying in this (it's probably fine))
10053   IGNORE	(Apache Range Header DoS | Simply said, Github Pages has to update their Apache2 to the stable somewhere later then 2011... This is a good reason why Cloudflare Pages might be beter to move to)
20012   IGNORE	(Anti-CSRF Tokens Check | This issue is the same as 10202, Paypal does this for us, so we can ignore this safely)
